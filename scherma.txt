## DATA
user1 = User.create(name: 'Hans', surname: 'Zizold')

## CREATING GROUPS AND OPERATIONS LIKE THIS WORKS, BUT THE MIDDLE TABLE DOESN'T UPDATE
group1 = Group.create(name: 'Basic Services', icon: 'basic.png', user: user1)
group2 = Group.create(name: 'Medical Services', icon: 'medical.png', user: user1)
group3 = Group.create(name: 'Supplies', icon: 'supplies.png', user: user1)
oper1 = Operation.create(name: 'Water', amount: 0, user: user1)
oper2 = Operation.create(name: 'Light', amount: 0, user: user1)
oper3 = Operation.create(name: 'Oculist', amount: 0, user: user1)
oper4 = Operation.create(name: 'Dentist', amount: 0, user: user1)
oper5 = Operation.create(name: 'Bulbs', amount: 50.00, user: user1)

## CREATING GROUPS AND OPERATIONS LIKE THIS WORKS, AND THE MIDDLE TABLE UPDATE SO YOU CAN CONSULT OPERATIONS FROM GROUPS AND VICE VERSA
group1.operations.create(name: 'Water', amount: 80.50, user: user1)
group1.operations.create(name: 'Light', amount: 201.65, user: user1)
group2.operations.create(name: 'Restaurant', amount: 285.00, user: user1)
group2.operations.create(name: 'Movies', amount: 84.00, user: user1)
group10.operations.create(name: 'Internet', amount: 299.00, user: user)
group10.operations.create(name: 'Fixed Line', amount: 31.10, user: user)

oper1.groups.create(name: 'Supplies', icon: 'supplies.png', user: user1)
